# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
This project presents the performance of Support Vector Machine to classify breast cancer. In this project, comparisons of results of different evaluation metrics for the four kernel functions namely linear, RBF, polynomial and sigmoid have shown that Radial Basis Function(RBF) kernel is the best among the four in terms of all the evaluation metrics discussed in the paper. RBF kernel showed maximum comparison accuracy of , F-score, ROC value on the validation set of the dataset choice for binary classification on the dataset.

The RBF kernel function is used on the test that that is 20% of the whole dataset and it has given the best result in the binary classification of benign and malignant tumor with only a single misclassification and accuracy of 99.12% . Thus, it can be concluded that RBF kernel function is preferred and is the best choice for an optimum result of the binary classification of breast cancer on WDBC dataset.

The algorithms are deployed on heroku server an can be accessed using the link: https://breast-cancer-predicitons-app.herokuapp.com

I have also published a research paper based on the findings. The pepaer can ber accessed at: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349705537_C_2021_IRJET_Impact_Factor_value_7529_ISO_90012008_Certified_Journal_Page_1732_Prediction_of_Breast_Cancer_using_Support_Vector_Machines
